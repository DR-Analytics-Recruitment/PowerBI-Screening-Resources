# Marking Rubric

The purpose of this marking key is to provide a standardized framework for evaluating the Power BI skills of candidates based on their submitted .pbix files. 

## Key Areas

### Criterion 1: Data Connectivity 
Evaluate how the candidate has integrated different data sources in the .pbix file.

- [ ] **Insufficient**
*	Data is not properly imported or connected.
*	Errors exist in the data connections.
  
- [ ] **Basic**
*	Data from basic sources (e.g., Excel) imported correctly.
*	No evident handling of more complex data sources.
  
- [ ] **Intermediate**
*	Multiple types of data sources integrated (timeseries, geolocation, sales)
*	Refresh paths properly configured.
  
- [ ] **Advanced**
*	Complex data sources integrated, with custom query handling.

### Criterion 2: Data Modeling 
Inspect the effectiveness and scalability of the data model in the .pbix file.

- [ ] **Insufficient**
*	Poorly structured data model; tables lack relationships or keys.
  
- [ ] **Basic**
*	Basic normalisation and relationships established.
  
- [ ] **Intermediate**
*	Data model is functional but may lack indexing or optimisation.
*	Basic understanding of facts and dimensions evident.

- [ ] **Advanced**
*	Highly optimised, multi-layer data model.
*	Evidence of understanding dimensional modeling.

### Criterion 3: DAX and Measures
Review the use of DAX for calculations and measures within the .pbix file.

- [ ] **Insufficient**
*	Lack of DAX formulas or incorrect implementations.

- [ ] **Basic**
*	Use of simple DAX formulas like SUM, COUNT.

- [ ] **Intermediate**
*	Utilises more advanced DAX functions, but may lack performance tuning.
  
- [ ] **Advanced**
*	Advanced DAX functions are used, and performance is optimised.

### Criterion 4: Insights and Analytics
Assess the quality and depth of insights generated from the visualisations.

- [ ] **Insufficient**
*	No actionable insights provided.
  
- [ ] **Basic**
*	Highlights basic trends but lacks depth.

- [ ] **Intermediate**
*	Includes some nuanced insights, but misses others.

- [ ] **Advanced**

### Criterion 5: Visualisation and Presentation
Evaluate the usability and aesthetic of the Power BI Dashboard.

- [ ] **Insufficient**
*	Poor layout and design, hard-to-interpret visualizations.

- [ ] **Basic**
*	Simple, readable charts but lacks advanced visual elements.

- [ ] **Intermediate**
*	Clean design with some advanced elements like drill-through or tooltips.

- [ ] **Advanced**

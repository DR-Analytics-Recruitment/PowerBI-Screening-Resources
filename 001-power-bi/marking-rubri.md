# Marking Rubric ✏️

The purpose of this marking key is to provide a standardised framework for evaluating the Power BI skills of candidates based on their submitted .pbix files. 
# Power BI Assessment Rubric

This repository contains the evaluation criteria used to assess Power BI skills during the hiring process. We aim for a evaluation that includes various facets of Power BI from data connectivity to presentation. Candidates' projects will be scored based on the following criteria. It's important to note that skill level and role seniority must be accounted for in evaluation.

## Data Connectivity

| Levels        | Description                                                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Insufficient  | Data is not properly imported or connected. Errors exist in the data connections.                            |
| Basic         | Data from basic sources (e.g., Excel) imported correctly. No evident handling of more complex data sources.  |
| Intermediate  | Multiple types of data sources integrated (timeseries, geolocation, sales). Refresh paths properly configured.|
| Advanced      | Complex data sources integrated, with custom query handling.                                                 |

## Data Modeling

| Levels        | Description                                                                                     |

| Basic         | Basic normalization and relationships established.                                              |
| Intermediate  | Data model is functional but may lack indexing or optimization. Basic understanding of facts and dimensions evident.|
| Advanced      | Highly optimised, multi-layer data model. Evidence of understanding dimensional modeling.         |

## DAX and Measures

| Levels        | Description                                                                   |

| Intermediate  | Utilizes more advanced DAX functions, but may lack performance tuning.         |
| Advanced      | Advanced DAX functions are used, and performance is optimised.                 |

## Insights and Analytics

| Levels        | Description                                                                           |

| Basic         | Simple, readable charts but lacks advanced visual elements.                        |
| Intermediate  | Clean design with some advanced elements like drill-through or tooltips.           |

## Scoring

Each criterion can be rated as `Insufficient`, `Basic`, `Intermediate`, or `Advanced`. You may choose to assign numerical scores to these qualitative ratings if you'd like to sum up the scores for an overall assessment.

- **Insufficient**: 1
